# ECH example data

In the file above you will find examples of transcripts collected for each project that ECH undertake.
Each file has a specific naming convention, that is matched by the audio file for each transcript in a separate folder on the computer.


A reference for the transcripts and audio files are then uploaded separately onto an archival system. The archival system only has a reference to where on the computer researchers can find a specific audio file/information, and does not include the data itself.

Photographs collected from interviewees and during interviews are also stored on the main computer, but in a different file.
