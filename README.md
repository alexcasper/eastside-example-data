# ECH example data

In the folders above you will find examples of the transcripts collected for a selection of ECH projects.
Each transcript file follows a specific naming convention that matches the original audio file, which is stored in a separate folder.


A reference for the transcripts and audio files are then uploaded separately onto an archival system on a different computer. The archival system only provides a reference to the file name on the main computer, and does not include the data itself. Researchers then have to find the particular file they are after by searching for it manually on the main computer.


Photographs collected from interviewees and taken during research are also stored on the main computer, but in a different folder.
